## Overview

This is short and simple QR code design, built with css and html and it's static, without animations. Just used simple css styles and html tags.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I've learned css styles and media tags to how to work with diferrent resolutions.

### Continued development

I'm certain that the root of becoming guru developer is putting work, dedication, hard work and unlimitless coding. I'm eager to become not only the frontend but the fullstack developer.
